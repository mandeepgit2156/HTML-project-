            <p id="highlight3">Jaipur Junction Antiques is deeply connected with the roots and has been constantly
                making efforts to preserve all the art forms, the techniques, the details. Since founded in late 1800's,
                if the community has striven towards one goal, that is to keep the art real. We today at JJA pay our
                regards to thousands of Jaipuri Communities and Ghasranas, who've made it possible to pass down the very
                soulful knowledge of art. These tribes and their art forms have been passed down to generations for
                decades now. It is our responsibility to pay homage to all the people who have spent their life for
                various arts that sit in our houses today. </p>
